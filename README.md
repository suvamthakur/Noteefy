Noteefy: A sticky note web application where you can create, edit, and organize sticky notes with ease, as well as archive and search created notes. Although user authentication has not been integrated into Noteefy at present, I will add this feature later on.
I have developed this project using EJS, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB to deliver a seamless user experience. MongoDB serves as the backbone of Noteefy's data management system.
